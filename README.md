# Topic-Modeling

**Disclaimer: Implementation Demo only, striking a balance between code optimization and readability**

* Variational Bayes (Hoffman et al. 2010)
 * Batch Variational Bayes
 * Online Variational Bayes (Stochastic)
 * Online Variational Bayes (Mini-batch)
 
 NB: For better topics, need more epochs, but difficult to do w/o having to further optimize, which affects readability.
